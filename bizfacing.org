* Presentation
*** Disclaimer
    One smartphone app to deal with any emergency patient, anytime,
    anywhere any language
    
    /Currently in development, seeking investors/
    
*** Motivation
    + Clinicians do not currently have a multilingual, multi-modular
      app to deal with all the specificities of an emergency patient
      encounter
    + Existing apps in the USA are highly profitable, but very limited in
     functionality
    + Potential market for such apps is global
   
*** App Market
    + Medical students, nurses, medics, physicians assistants and doctors
      with smartphones
    + Nearly all doctors have smartphones--even in most African and Asian
      countries
    + 3 billion a year market in USA alone
    + The market for such a product could be predicted by the performance
      of similar yet inferior apps already on the market.  *Epocrates* 50%
      penetrance of American physicians, revenues well over 500 million
      each year for last three years.  *PEPID* private company, low
      penetrance, lack of reliable data on revenues
    + Mobile health app market is projected to hit 26 billion in revenue
      by 2017
   
*** Building The First Modules
    + Staff salaries (3 programmers, one medical leader, one business
      manager): 1,000,000 NIS, or $250,000
    + Equipment (mobile phones, computers, additional cameras): 50,000 NIS
    + Expert consultations: 25,000 NIS
    + Workspace for meetings, food, other: 25,000 NIS
    + Total cost: 1,100,000 NIS or about $300,000
   
*** Development Plan
    + Develop each module and release for sale separately to be put inside
      the app shell which has one small free module (a compacted
      translation phrasebook)
    + Development of translation module in first 3 months, release with
      heavy marketing through Ministry of Health and Hospitals, post
      release surveillance and improvement, and free partial phrasebook
    + Development of skin module next in parallel with development of
      other modules that are closer to apps on the market i.e. medical
      dictionary module, drug information and interaction model etc.
    + Exit strategy: At one year in case of incomplete funding: sell
      existing modules to well funded companies or Ministry of Health
      Israel, in case of good profitability: go public.
   
*** Product Looks
    /three phone screens here/
    
*** Team
    + Dr. Candace Makeda Moore, MD; (emergency doc, photographer, founder)
    + Dr. Jeremy Rutman, PhD, (patent attorney, computer programmer/image
      processing, physicist)
    + Mike Green, MS (biologist, computer programmer)
    + Hagar Shilo, BA (front end developer, linguist)
   
*** Accomplishments
    + Built website
    + Development of translation module underway, prototype/demo to be
      completed on December 24^{th}, internal documents with algorithm and
      design specifics currently in company dropbox
    + Collaboration with Trendiguru vis a vis Dr. Rutman to receive
      algorithms for machine based 3D object recognition
   
*** The Real Plan
    + As new modules are developed, starting with translation module
    + Try to sell modules to rivals i.e. PEPID, Epocrates, etc.
    + Try to push national acquisitions due to legal noncompliance
      (providing care in patient's language mandated in some countries)
    + Business-wise we may be beat to market on some modules, but each can
      be unpacked and sold once developed
