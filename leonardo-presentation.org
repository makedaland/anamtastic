* Presentation
** Problems
*** Problems
    + Emergency care practitioners are under extreme time pressure
    + Significant portion of time taken for communication with  patient 
    + Language barriers lengthen time and accuracy of information
    + Doctors are expected to remember all protocols 
    + Doctors expected to remember all drugs, all side effect, all
      interactions, all differential diagnoses, all lab values
    + These are unrealistic expectations which literally kill patients
    + Potential market for such apps is global
    
** Solutions
*** Proposed
    + Anamastic is an app that addresses critical issues for patient
      treatment and communication.
    + Anamtastic will be a multimodular app that the clinician can
      tailor to her specific emergency setting
   
*** Existing
    + Communication: right now translation in Israel is happening
      ad-hoc based on a failing phone system from the MOH, google
      translate and limited staff capabilities. If there was a better
      tool we would all be using it.

** App Market
*** App Market
    + Medical students, nurses, medics, physicians assistants and doctors
      with smartphones
    + Nearly all doctors have smartphones--even in most African and Asian
      countries
    + 3 billion a year market in USA alone
    + The market for such a product could be predicted by the performance
      of similar yet inferior apps already on the market.  *Epocrates* 50%
      penetrance of American physicians, revenues well over 500 million
      each year for last three years.  *PEPID* private company, low
      penetrance, lack of reliable data on revenues
    + Mobile health app market is projected to hit 26 billion in revenue
      by 2017

** Costs And Plan
*** Building The First Modules
    + Staff salaries (3 programmers, one medical leader, one business
      manager): 1,000,000 NIS, or $250,000
    + Equipment (mobile phones, computers, additional cameras): 50,000
      NIS
    + Expert consultations: 25,000 NIS
    + Workspace for meetings, food, other: 25,000 NIS
    + Total cost: 1,100,000 NIS or about $300,000

*** January 2017 Plan And Costs
    + Goal: Build prototype translation module and shell
    + Equipment (mobile phones, computers, additional cameras): 5,000
      NIS
    + Expert consultations with front end designers: 25,000 NIS
    + Expert programmer with background as medic 5,000 NIS consult
    + Workspace for meetings, food, other: 5,000 NIS
    + Total cost: 40,000 NIS

** Development Plan
*** Development Plan
    + Develop each module and release for sale separately to be put inside
      the app shell which has one small free module (a compacted
      translation phrasebook)
    + Development of translation module in first 3 months, release with
      heavy marketing through Ministry of Health and Hospitals, post
      release surveillance and improvement, and free partial phrasebook
    + Development of skin module next in parallel with development of
      other modules that are closer to apps on the market i.e. medical
      dictionary module, drug information and interaction model etc.
    + Exit strategy: At one year in case of incomplete funding: sell
      existing modules to well funded companies or Ministry of Health
      Israel, in case of good profitability: go public.

** Accomplishments
*** Accomplishments
    + Built website
    + Development of translation module underway, prototype/demo to be
      completed on December 24^{th}, internal documents with algorithm and
      design specifics currently in company dropbox
    + Collaboration with Trendiguru vis a vis Dr. Rutman to receive
      algorithms for machine based 3D object recognition
   
** The Real Plan
*** The Real Plan
    + As new modules are developed, starting with translation module
    + Try to sell modules to rivals i.e. PEPID, Epocrates, etc.
    + Try to push national acquisitions due to legal noncompliance
      (providing care in patient's language mandated in some countries)
    + Business-wise we may be beat to market on some modules, but each can
      be unpacked and sold once developed
